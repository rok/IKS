p=. **20TH INTERNATIONAL KARSTOLOGICAL SCHOOL "CLASSICAL KARST"**
*KARST FORMS AND PROCESSES*
Postojna, June 18th to 23rd 2012

organised by:

**KARST RESEARCH INSTITUTE ZRC SAZU**

Since 1993, International Karstological Schools have been organised, covering many aspects of karst research. The basic idea of the School has been to present the state of the art in selected topics and promote discussion between participants via set of lectures, poster sessions and related field trips to the area of Slovene Classical karst. 
Research in the last two decades has contributed new findings in many topics of these past schools. Therefore, the 20 ^th^ IKS is an opportunity to review our current understanding of typical karst forms and processes, stress the research advances in the last two decades and define challenges and perspectives for the next generation.

**The work will include**
* Invited keynote lectures covering wide range of topic
* selected lectures by other participants
* poster presentations
* fieldwork

**The topics will cover**
* processes and forms on karst surface and caves in different setting
* role of dissolution, sediment tranport, tectonics, climate and life in karst morphogenesis
* regional karst development
* man's impact on karst

Senior and junior karst researchers, students, managers of karst resources and other people interested in karst phenomena.
