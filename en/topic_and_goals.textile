h2. Topic and goals

Since 1993, International Karstological Schools have been organised, covering many aspects of karst research. The basic idea of the School has been to present the state of the art in selected topics and promote discussion between participants via set of lectures, poster sessions and related field trips to the area of Slovene Classical karst. 
Research in the last two decades has contributed new findings in many topics of these past schools. Therefore, the 20th IKS is an opportunity to review our current understanding of typical karst forms and processes, stress the research advances in the last two decades and define challenges and perspectives for the next generation.
